## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
```

### Running n8n using Docker Compose

#### For Nvidia GPU users

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
> [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

### For AMD GPU users on Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up
```

#### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

If you’re using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU
to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU, like in the section "For everyone else"
   below
2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the
   n8n instance

If you want to run Ollama on your mac, check the
[Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/)
for installation instructions, and run the starter kit as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose up
```

##### For Mac users running OLLAMA locally

If you're running OLLAMA locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable

1. Set OLLAMA_HOST to `host.docker.internal:11434` in your .env file. 
2. Additionally, after you see "Editor is now accessible via: <http://localhost:5678/>":

    1. Head to <http://localhost:5678/home/credentials>
    2. Click on "Local Ollama service"
    3. Change the base URL to "http://host.docker.internal:11434/"

#### For everyone else

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## ⚡️ Quick start and usage

The core of the Self-hosted AI Starter Kit is a Docker Compose file, pre-configured with network and storage settings, minimizing the need for additional installations.
After completing the installation steps above, simply follow the steps below to get started.

1. Open <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser to set up n8n. You’ll only
   have to do this once.
2. Open the included workflow:
   <http://localhost:5678/workflow/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb>
3. Click the **Chat** button at the bottom of the canvas, to start running the workflow.
4. If this is the first time you’re running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.2. You can inspect the docker
   console logs to check on the progress.

To open n8n at any time, visit <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser.

With your n8n instance, you’ll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.

> [!NOTE]
> This starter kit is designed to help you get started with self-hosted AI
> workflows. While it’s not fully optimized for production environments, it
> combines robust components that work well together for proof-of-concept
> projects. You can customize it to meet your specific needs

## Tips & tricks

### Accessing local files

The self-hosted AI starter kit will create a shared folder (by default,
located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you’ll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.

## 🚀 Production deployment with Traefik and custom domain

These compose files are ready to run behind a reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS using Traefik.

### Step-by-step guide (DigitalOcean / Ubuntu)

1. Create droplet
   - Ubuntu LTS, at least 2 CPU / 4 GB RAM recommended
   - Add your SSH key

2. Point DNS
   - Create an A record: `n8n.vibra-media.com -> <your-droplet-ip>`

3. Install Docker and Compose plugin
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
   sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
   echo \
     "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
     $(. /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION_CODENAME) stable" | \
     sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   sudo apt-get update -y
   sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
   ```

4. Clone the repo and configure environment
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
   cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set strong secrets and your real domain/email
   ```

5. Prepare cert storage
   ```bash
   touch acme.json
   chmod 600 acme.json
   ```

6. Start the stack
   - CPU only:
     ```bash
     docker compose --profile cpu up -d
     ```
   - Nvidia GPU:
     ```bash
     docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up -d
     ```
   - AMD GPU:
     ```bash
     docker compose --profile gpu-amd up -d
     ```

7. Verify
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f traefik n8n | cat
   ```
   - Wait for Traefik to obtain certificates
   - Open `https://n8n.vibra-media.com` in your browser

8. Updates
   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   docker compose create && docker compose --profile cpu up -d
   ```

### One-command interactive deploy

You can use the provided script to interactively configure `.env` and start the stack with Traefik:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The script will:

- Ask for your domain (e.g., `n8n.vibra-media.com`) and Let's Encrypt email
- Generate strong secrets for n8n
- Optionally enable Qdrant and/or Ollama, and choose the runtime profile (CPU / GPU)
- Create `acme.json` (600 permissions) and a `shared/` folder
- Start the selected services with `docker compose`

#### Local testing

For local testing without Traefik/HTTPS (direct port access):

```bash
./deploy.sh --local
```

This will:
- Use `localhost` instead of a domain
- Skip Traefik and Let's Encrypt setup
- Expose n8n directly on `http://localhost:5678`
- Optionally expose Qdrant on `http://localhost:6333` and Ollama on `http://localhost:11434`
- Create a `docker-compose.local.yml` override file for port exposure

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu server (e.g., DigitalOcean droplet) with Docker and Docker Compose plugin installed
- DNS A record for your domain pointing to the server (e.g., `n8n.vibra-media.com`)
- Firewall allows inbound ports 80 and 443

### 1) Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set at minimum:
# - POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB
# - N8N_HOST=n8n.vibra-media.com
# - WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.vibra-media.com/
# - LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=you@vibra-media.com
```

### 2) Prepare certificate storage for Traefik

```bash
touch acme.json
chmod 600 acme.json
```

### 3) Start the stack

CPU only:
```bash
docker compose --profile cpu up -d
```

Nvidia GPU:
```bash
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up -d
```

AMD GPU:
```bash
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up -d
```

### 4) Check logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f traefik n8n
```

### 5) Access your instance

Open https://n8n.vibra-media.com in your browser. Traefik will automatically request and store a Let's Encrypt TLS certificate in `acme.json`.

Notes:

- Only `n8n` is publicly exposed via Traefik. `Postgres`, `Qdrant`, and `Ollama` are private on the Docker network.
- To add future apps, attach them to the `traefik_proxy` network and add Traefik labels.
